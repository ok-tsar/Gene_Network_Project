Integrative Framework for Model Based Phenotype-Specific Gene Analysis and Influence Network Construction.
Overall Schematic (Left Panel): This schematic outlines our integrated, model-agnostic approach for inferring genotype-phenotype relationships using deep learning models. The two-step approach consists of (1) determining a trained model’s phenotype-specific gene importance, then (2) constructing gene influence networks from the model’s insights. This approach allows for use models as proxies for decoding biological processes, leveraging the trained model to elucidate complex genetic interactions. The data sources delineated for each procedural step pertain to the datasets employed to validate and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.
Methodological Detail and Validation (Right Panel): The right side delves deeper into the methodology and shows our analytical steps to prove its effectiveness, starting with the green section which details the phenotype-specific gene importance analysis. This includes (1a) individual gene permutation testing to rank gene importance, (1b) gene importance cutoff modeling to determine the most critical genes, and (1c) critical gene analysis for validation against other feature selection methodologies and confirmation of their biological relevance. In the purple section, we explore the influence networks built upon the top 100 genes for each model evaluated. Here, we assess permutation-based prediction effect similarity (2a), apply smart clustering to uncover gene clusters (2b), perform individual cluster analysis to compare with known gene interactions (2c), and conduct combined cluster analysis (2d) to observe the interaction complexity.
